Document content is what most [modules](xref:about-modules) manipulate and it's what will presumably be output to disk at the end of a [pipeline](xref:pipelines-and-modules).Document content is often read from files, though it can also come from a database, a web service, or any other source. Documents are immutable and must be cloned to change their content.
