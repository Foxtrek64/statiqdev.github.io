Title: Getting Started With Statiq Framework

# About

Statiq Framework is a powerful and extensible static generation toolkit that you can use to create your own special-purpose static generator applications.
As the fundamental building blocks of [Statiq Web](/web) and [Statiq Docs](/docs) it's also important to undertand the underlying concepts and features
since projects using those applications can also benefit from extensibility through Statiq Framework fucntionality.
