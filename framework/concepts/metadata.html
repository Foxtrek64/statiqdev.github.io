<p>Along with its content, every <a href="/framework/concepts/documents">document</a> contains <em>metadata</em>. As with documents, metadata is immutable and you must clone a document to add additional metadata. Several <a href="/framework/concepts/modules">modules</a>, such as <code>SetMetadata</code>, are designed to allow you to manipulate document metadata as part of your <a href="/framework/concepts/pipelines">pipeline</a>.</p>
<h1 id="front-matter">Front Matter</h1>
<p>One of the more common ways to set metadata is to use <em>front matter</em>. Front matter is a common concept in static generators and gets around the problem of how to define metadata for a file without creating a whole separate file. Typically, front matter is placed at the top of an input file and uses some sort of format (like YAML or JSON) to define key/value pairs. In Statiq, front matter can be extracted using the <code>ExtractFrontMatter</code> module. That module accepts child modules that process whatever content is contained in the front matter block, such as YAML or JSON. Often front matter is delimited from the actual file content by a series of dashes such as <code>---</code>, though an alternate delimiter can be specified in the module.</p>
<p>A file that contains front matter might look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">Title: Some Title
Description: This is a description.
Date: 5/25/2016
---
This is the content of the file.
</code></pre>
<p>An example of front matter usage would be using metadata to define tags for your blog posts. You could create a &quot;Tags&quot; metadata field in the front matter of your post file and then read that metadata later to create tag clouds, lists of similar posts, etc.</p>
<p>Practically, the <code>ParseYaml</code> module is usually used as the child of the <code>ExtractFrontMatter</code> module. However, like most things in Statiq Framework this is designed to be flexible. You could process any type of front matter (JSON, etc.) with this setup by specifying different child modules.</p>
<h1 id="accessing-metadata">Accessing Metadata</h1>
<p>Every <a href="/framework/concepts/documents">document</a> acts like a dictionary and implements <code>IReadOnlyDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code> for easy access. Metadata key/value pairs can be accessed through this interface.</p>
<h2 id="type-conversion">Type Conversion</h2>
<p>All metadata is represented internally as raw objects. This allows you to store not just strings, but more complex data as well. However, when you access metadata you probably don't want to think about how it's stored or what the original type was. For example, YAML doesn't really distinguish between numbers and strings when it reads data, it's only when getting a value that you care. To make metadata as easy to work with as possible, Statiq Framework includes a very powerful type conversion capability that lets you convert nearly any metadata value to any other compatible type.</p>
<p>When converting metadata values, all .NET type conversion techniques are checked including <code>TypeConverter</code>, <code>IConvertible</code>, casting, etc. The conversion support is provided by a fork of the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/248440/Universal-Type-Converter">UniversalTypeConverter</a> library. Type conversion capabilities can also be accessed directly through the static <code>TypeHelper</code> class and new conversions can be added at run-time through it's <code>RegisterTypeConverter</code> methods.</p>
<p>Converting between type of a sequence or from a single item to a sequence is also supported. If you request an <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>, or array of <code>T</code> and the metadata value is also enumerable, all elements will be converted to the requested type <code>T</code> and those that cannot be converted will be omitted from the result. If the metadata value is not enumerable, it will be returned as a single element of the requested enumerable type.</p>
<h2 id="metadata-lookup">Metadata Lookup</h2>
<p>There are several extensions to make working with documents and metadata easier. One of the more powerful ones lets you generate an <code>ILookup&lt;T, IDocument&gt;</code> from a sequence of documents based on a metadata key. The signature of the extension method is <code>ILookup&lt;T, IDocument&gt; ToLookup&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;IDocument&gt; documents, string key)</code> where <code>key</code> is the metadata key that you want to generate a lookup for.</p>
<p>For example, say you have a sequence of documents, some of which contain metadata for the key &quot;Tags&quot;. Also, assume that some of the documents with &quot;Tags&quot; metadata contain a single value some contain arrays. If you simply call <code>Documents.ToLookup&lt;string&gt;(&quot;Tags&quot;)</code> you will get back an <code>ILookup&lt;T, IDocument&gt;</code> keyed by each possible tag string with a sequence of the documents that contain that tag as the value.</p>
