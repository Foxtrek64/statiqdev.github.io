<ul>
<li>Renamed the GitHub project/repo to &quot;Statiq.Framework&quot; to match forthcoming &quot;Statiq.Web&quot; and to distinguish between primary code repos (prefixed by &quot;Statiq.&quot;) and themes, etc. Also note the upcoming Statiq app will be known as Statiq Web from now on (as opposed to Statiq Framework).</li>
<li>The engine now returns a <code>IPipelineOutputs</code> with the result documents from each pipeline.</li>
<li>Adds global events <code>BeforeModuleExecution</code> and <code>AfterModuleExecution</code> with ability to override outputs.</li>
<li>Adds a new global event mechanism via <code>IEventCollection</code>, <code>IReadOnlyEventCollection</code>, <code>IEngine.Events</code>, and <code>IExecutionContext.Events</code>.</li>
<li>Refactored the base module classes to include a before/after execution method, made the execution methods <code>protected</code>, and renamed the execution methods for clarity.</li>
<li>Added property setters with null checks to <code>Pipeline</code> so it works better as a base class and you can define the phase modules directly as properties.</li>
<li>Cleaned up <code>ModuleList</code> methods to remove overload ambiguity between <code>params IModule[]</code> and <code>IEnumerable&lt;IModule&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Added an implicit operator from <code>IModule[]</code> to <code>ModuleList</code>.</li>
<li>Raw application arguments as well as application input are now surfaced through a new <code>IReadOnlyApplicationState</code> object in the <code>IExecutionContext</code>, taking the place of the <code>ApplicationInput</code> property.</li>
<li>Adds a bunch of <code>Config.FromSettings()</code> methods that get values from a <code>IReadOnlySettings</code>.</li>
<li>&quot;Pipeline&quot; is now trimmed from the end of type names when types are added as a pipeline to a pipeline collection.</li>
</ul>
